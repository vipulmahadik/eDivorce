      <p>Sorry, but at this point in time you will not be able to complete your
      application using this online tool.</p>

      <p>As someone living in a marriage-like relationship, you have several
      options for dealing with your separation. Many separating couples can
      agree about how they're going to deal with parenting, property, and child
      and spousal support without ever going to court. If you and your spouse
      or partner can come to an agreement, you'll save yourselves time, money,
      and emotional turmoil, as well as keep control of important decisions
      that affect your family.</p>
